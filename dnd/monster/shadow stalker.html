            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Incorporeal Movement.</span> The shadow stalker can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Light Sensitivity.</span> While in bright light, the shadow stalker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shadow Stealth.</span> While in dim light or darkness, the shadow stalker can take the Hide action as a bonus action.<br><br>

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Death Burn.</span> When the shadow stalker dies, nonmagical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area and able to see the bright light must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage and, if the creature can see the light, is blinded until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded.
